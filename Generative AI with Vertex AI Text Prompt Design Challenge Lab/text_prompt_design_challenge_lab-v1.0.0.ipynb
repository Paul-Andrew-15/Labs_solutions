    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This challenge lab is designed to test your knowledge of calling Gemini and utilizing a few fundamental text prompt design techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two featured guides on prompting from the Google Cloud documentation are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Overview of prompting strategies](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/prompt-design-strategies) from the Generative AI on Vertex AI documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. [Prompt design strategies](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/prompting-strategies) from the Gemini API documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both contain good tips. You are encouraged to **bookmark them**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "You will demonstrate your ability to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Initialize Vertex AI in your environment\n",
    "- Load a generative model\n",
    "- Guide model output with a persona\n",
    "- Extract information to a schema\n",
    "- Stay on topic with fallback responses\n",
    "- Use examples to influence the model's response\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the following Python notebook cells have missing or incomplete code sections and tasks that need to be completed, indicated by the code comments starting with `# TODO`. Your challenge is to complete each cell, run it to test for correctness, and then move on. When all the cells are working, you have completed the challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** If you need help, [this notebook demonstrates getting started using Gemini in Python](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/generative-ai/blob/main/gemini/getting-started/intro_gemini_python.ipynb)."

      "2. **Scattering of Light:** These molecules are much smaller than the wavelengths of visible light. When sunlight hits them, it gets scattered in all directions. However, shorter wavelengths of light (like blue and violet) are scattered much more effectively than longer wavelengths (like red and orange).\n",

      "**Compound Exercises (Working multiple muscle groups simultaneously):**\n",

      "    * Variations: Back squats, front squats, goblet squats, Bulgarian split squats\n",
      "* **Deadlifts:** Fantastic for overall posterior chain strength, targeting glutes, hamstrings, and back. \n",
      "    * Variations: Conventional deadlifts, sumo deadlifts, Romanian deadlifts (RDL)\n",
      "* **Lunges:** Excellent for unilateral leg work, improving balance and targeting quads, glutes, and hamstrings. \n",
      "    * Variations: Forward lunges, reverse lunges, walking lunges, lateral lunges\n",
      "* **Step-ups:** Another great unilateral exercise that mimics a functional movement pattern, working quads, glutes, and hamstrings. \n",
      "* **Hip thrusts:**  Specifically targets the glutes, improving power and hip extension.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Isolation Exercises (Focusing on a specific muscle group):**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Leg Extensions:** Primarily targets the quads.\n",
      "* **Hamstring Curls:**  Primarily targets the hamstrings.\n",
      "* **Calf Raises:**  Targets the calf muscles.\n",
      "    * Variations: Seated calf raises (emphasize soleus), standing calf raises (emphasize gastrocnemius)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Bodyweight Exercises (No equipment needed):**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Bodyweight Squats:**  Can be done anywhere, anytime.\n",
      "* **Lunges:**  Can be done with variations for added challenge.\n",
      "* **Glute Bridges:**  Effective for activating and strengthening the glutes.\n",
      "* **Calf Raises:**  Can be done on a step or flat surface.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Tips for Effective Leg Workouts:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Proper Form:**  Prioritize form over weight to avoid injuries. Watch videos and ask a trainer if unsure.\n",
      "* **Progressive Overload:** Gradually increase the weight, reps, or sets over time to challenge your muscles.\n",
      "* **Rest and Recovery:**  Give your legs adequate rest between sets and workouts to allow for muscle repair and growth.\n",
      "* **Listen to Your Body:**  Don't push through pain. Modify or stop an exercise if needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Remember:** The best leg exercises for you will depend on your individual fitness level, goals, and any pre-existing conditions. Consult a healthcare professional or certified trainer to create a safe and effective program tailored to your needs. \n",
